I understood the importance in principle of public key cryptography but it's all moved much faster than I expected. I did not expect it to be a mainstay of advanced communications technology.

\nemchapterfirstletter{B}{lockchain} technology demands the use of some cryptographic concepts.
\codenamespace is using cryptography based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
The choice of the underlying curve is important in order to guarantee security and speed.

\codenamespace has chosen to use the \emph{Twisted Edwards curve}:
$$ -x^2 + y^2 = 1 - \frac{121665}{121666} x^2 y^2$$
over the finite field defined by the prime number $2^{255}-19$ together with the digital signature algorithm called Ed25519\index{Ed25519}.
The base point for the corresponding group G is called B. The group has $q=2^{252} + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493$ elements.
It was developed by D. J. Bernstein et al. and is one of the safest and fastest digital signature algorithms \cite{Bernstein2011}.
For the hash function $H$ mentioned in the paper, \codenamespace uses the 512 bit SHA3 hash function.

Importantly for \codenamespace purposes, the algorithm produces short 64 byte signatures and supports fast signature verification.
Neither key generation nor signing is used during block processing, so the speed of these operations is unimportant.

\subsection{Public/Private Key Pair}

A \nind{private key} is a random 256-bit integer $k$. To derive the public key \underline{A} from it, the following steps are taken:
\begin{align}
H(k) &=(h_0, h_1,..., h_{511}) \\
a &= 2^{254} + \sum_{3\leq i \leq 253} 2^i h_i \label{a} \\
A &= aB
\end{align}
Since $A$ is a group element, it can be encoded into a 256-bit integer \underline{A}, which serves as the public key.

\subsection{Signing and Verification}

Given a message $M$, private key $k$ and its associated public key \underline{A}, the following steps are taken to create a signature:
\begin{align}
H(k) &=(h_0, h_1,..., h_{511}) \\
r &= H(h_{256},...,h_{511}, M) \text{ where the comma means concatenation} \\
R &= rB \\
S &= (r + H(\underline{R}, \underline{A}, M)a) \: mod \: q \label{S}
\end{align}

Then $(\underline{R}, \underline{S})$ is the \nind{signature} for the message $M$ under the private key $k$.
Note that only signatures where $S<q$ and $S>0$ are considered as valid \textbf{to prevent} the problem of \emph{signature malleability}\index{signature!malleability}.

To verify the signature $(\underline{R}, \underline{S})$ for the given message $M$ and public key \underline{A} one checks $S<q$ and $S>0$ and then calculates
\begin{align*}
\tilde{R} = SB - H(\underline{R}, \underline{A}, M)A
\end{align*}
and verifies that
\begin{equation}\label{veri}
\tilde{R} = R
\end{equation}
If $S$ was computed as shown in \eqref{S} then
$$SB = rB + (H(\underline{R}, \underline{A}, M)a)B = R + H(\underline{R}, \underline{A}, M)A$$
so \eqref{veri} will hold.
